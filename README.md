I invite you to familiarize yourself with the projects in which I participated. I divided the section into commercial and non-commercial projects.
Commercial projects are those that I participated in while working at [*Lionbridge*](https://games.lionbridge.com/), and non-commercial projects are those that I do after work to improve my skills.
* Commercial projects
  * [*Weird West*](https://www.weirdwest.com/) - game from WolfEye Studios. 
* Non-commercial projects
